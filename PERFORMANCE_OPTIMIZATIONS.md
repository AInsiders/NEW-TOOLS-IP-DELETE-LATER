- **Impact**: Massive reduction in physics calculations and rendering overhead

### 2. **Mouse Trail Completely Removed**
- **Trail Function**: Entire `drawMouseTrail()` function removed
- **Trail Tracking**: All mouse trail point tracking removed from `handleMouseMove()`
- **Trail Rendering**: No more gradient trails, particles, or sparkles
- **Impact**: Eliminates the most resource-intensive rendering operations

### 3. **Ultra-Optimized Node Movement**

- **Impact**: Minimal computational overhead for smooth 120fps

### 4. **120fps Performance Monitoring**
- **Frame Time Target**: 8.33ms (120fps threshold)
- **Performance Mode**: Activates when frame time > 8.33ms
- **Connection Reduction**: Automatically reduces to 80px when performance drops
- **Recovery**: Gradually restores to 120px when performance is good
- **Impact**: Maintains consistent 120fps even on varying hardware

### 5. **Canvas Rendering Optimizations**
- **Device Pixel Ratio**: Proper DPR scaling for crisp rendering
- **Canvas Sizing**: Optimized resize function
- **Impact**: Better performance on high-DPI displays

### 6. **Visibility API Integration**
- **Page Visibility**: Animation pauses when page is not visible
- **Resource Conservation**: Prevents unnecessary calculations
- **Impact**: Significant battery and CPU savings

## üîß Technical Implementation - 120fps

### **Ultra-Optimized Movement**
```javascript
// Only 20% of frames get random movement
if (Math.random() < 0.2) {
    node.vx += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.008;
    node.vy += (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.008;
}
```

### **120fps Performance Monitoring**
```javascript
if (frameTime > 8.33) { // 120fps threshold
    performanceMode = true;
    maxConnectionDistance = Math.max(80, maxConnectionDistance - 15);
}
```

### **Mouse Trail Removal**
```javascript
// Mouse trail tracking completely removed
// No more trail points, particles, or sparkles
```

## üîÑ Future Optimization Opportunities

If further optimization is needed for 120fps:

1. **WebGL Rendering**: Convert to WebGL for hardware acceleration
2. **Object Pooling**: Reuse objects instead of creating new ones
3. **Level of Detail**: Further reduce effects based on device performance
4. **Web Workers**: Move calculations to background threads
5. **RequestIdleCallback**: Use idle time for non-critical calculations
